# Quantum Time Analyzer

**Note: This project is currently in beta and is being used for testing purposes.**

This is a C# program that simulates the time evolution of a quantum system consisting of particles. It calculates the time-dependent wavefunction for each particle and visualizes it over a given simulation time and time resolution.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you need to have the following installed:

- .NET Framework
- System.Numerics
- System.Numerics.Vectors

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in a C# IDE or editor.
3. Build and run the program.

## Usage

1. Enter the number of particles.
2. Enter the time resolution.
3. Enter the simulation time.
4. The program will simulate the time evolution of the quantum system and display the time-dependent wavefunctions for each particle.
